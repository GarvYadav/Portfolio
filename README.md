# Portfolio
<br>
<p><!--This portfolio website is a fully responsive, single-page application developed using semantic HTML5 and modular CSS. The layout is structured with clear sections (#hero, #about, #projects, and #contact), enabling logical flow and accessibility. Navigation is implemented using an unordered list inside a <nav> element, promoting clean UX with internal anchor links for smooth scrolling. The header and footer encapsulate global site structure, while section elements modularize content, enhancing semantic clarity. The styling, applied via an external stylesheet (style.css), utilizes flexbox and box-model properties to create a consistent, centered layout. The visual design employs a monochromatic theme with accent colors (#007bff) for emphasis, complemented by hover effects for interactivity. Typography is managed through a system font stack ("Segoe UI", sans-serif) for performance and readability. The .project-card class applies styling for project listings using custom paddings, borders, and background color to visually separate content blocks. The site is optimized for various screen sizes using relative units (em, %) and a responsive <meta viewport> tag. External links to GitHub repositories are included to demonstrate project source code, with each link contextually embedded within headings. Overall, the implementation reflects best practices in frontend development, emphasizing maintainability, responsiveness, and clean UI presentation using only HTML and CSS.--></p>
